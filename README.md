# Demo Quickstart
To run the demos download and install [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com)  (there is a free community version).  You can install Visual Studio on Windows or Mac.  To run the demos:

1) Open the solution in Visual Studio.
2) Select either iOS or Droid project as the startup.
3) Select your emulator or device.
4) Click run.

The demos where created and tested using [Visual Studio 2017 Mac](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/mac/).  That said they should run on Windows but you will need a Mac (lapotp or desktop) to compile and run the iOS parts of the demos.  All the requirements to run Xamarin can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/cross-platform/get-started/requirements).
